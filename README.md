# EllipseFit
*Ellipse fitting and plotting in Julia*

EllipseFit is a small collection of code written in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) for fitting an ellipse to data. The data can be fit either using [linear least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares) or [orthogonal distance regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_least_squares) by solving a nonlinear least squares problem ([NNLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-linear_least_squares)).

Most helpful are a handful of plotting utility functions for plotting ellipses which comes up frequently enough in some of my self studying to warrant this module. There are helpers for plotting ellipses in conic section form, quadratic forms, and parametric form.

# Examples
Examples of how to use the some of the functions in this module are provided in the [Examples](https://github.com/chaaland/EllipseFit.jl/tree/master/examples) folder
